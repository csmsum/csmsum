# Using Latex in iCloud (path containing "~")

Latexmk does not allow you to use ~ in your directory, so you will find it not quite easy to sync tex files through iCloud.

Instead, there is another way to bypass the problem, which is available when you are [using Latex Workshop within your Visual Studio Code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36917629/latexing-within-icloud-drive).

In your VsCode, go to "Latex: Tools" and you'll find the yaml file. Within the yaml file, replace `%DOC%`  with `%DOCFILE%`. I don't know how it works, but James Yu, the creator of the extention Latex Workshop says it's better way than trying relative path(where this might cause some errors).

If you cannot find the yaml file, first go to Text Editor Settings by `Cmd + ,`  and search
``` {vscode}
@ext:James-Yu.latex-workshop tools
```

Within the yaml file, you may replace all `%DOC%`  with `%DOCFILE%`. It works afterwards.
